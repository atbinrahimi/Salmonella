            <div class="money-usage-container">
                <p>Salmonella is found in raw or undercooked meat, eggs, and seafood. These foods can carry the bacteria that makes people sick. For example, raw chicken or eggs may look fine but can still have salmonella inside. If these foods are not cooked all the way, or if they are handled in the wrong way, the bacteria can spread.</p>

        <section id="money-acquisition">
            <h2>How do people get salmonella?</h2>
            <div class="money-acquisition-container">
                <p>People can get salmonella by eating food that has the bacteria in it. This happens when food is not cooked enough or when raw food touches other food, like vegetables or bread. It can also spread if someone touches raw meat and then touches other things without washing their hands. Another way to get sick is by drinking unpasteurized milk, which has not been cleaned by heat.</p>

        <section id="winning-strategy">
            <h2>What are symptoms of foodborne illness caused by salmonella?</h2>
            <div class="winning-strategy-container">
                <p>If someone gets sick from salmonella, they might have diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms can start a few hours or days after eating the bad food. Most people get better in a few days, but some people like babies, older people, or those who are already sick can get very sick and may need to go to the hospital.</p>

            <h2>5 things you can do to prevent salmonella from your kitchen:</h2>
            <div class="references-container">
                <p>1. Wash fruits and vegetables – Always clean them under running water to remove any dirt or bacteria.</p>
                <p>2. Keep raw meat away from other foods – Use different cutting boards and knives so germs don't spread.</p>
                <p>3. Defrost frozen food safely – Thaw it in the fridge or microwave, not on the counter.</p>
                <p>4. Don't drink raw (unpasteurized) milk – Always choose milk that has been heated to kill germs.</p>
                <p>5. Cook food all the way through – Use a food thermometer or cut inside to make sure it's not raw. Chicken should not be pink inside.</p>
